description: Ensure all UI specs include mobile-first layout rules, touch targets, and responsive typography.

Whenever producing UI or page specs:
- Provide mobile layout first (single column defaults).
- Minimum touch target 44x44.
- Typography scales down gracefully; avoid cramped line-height.
- Navigation collapses appropriately; avoid clutter.
- Check spacing rhythm on 375px width.
