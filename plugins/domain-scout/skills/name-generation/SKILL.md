# Domain Name Generation Best Practices

Apply these principles when generating domain name suggestions for websites and applications.

## Core Principles

### Length Guidelines

- **Ideal**: 6-10 characters
- **Acceptable**: Up to 15 characters
- **Avoid**: 20+ characters (hard to remember and type)

Short names are easier to remember, type, and share verbally.

### Memorability Rules

1. **Easy to spell**: Avoid unusual spellings unless intentional brand choice
2. **Easy to pronounce**: Say it out loud - can you tell someone over the phone?
3. **Easy to remember**: One exposure should be enough
4. **No confusion**: Avoid homophones (write/right), numbers (4/for), hyphens

### Character Rules

- **Use**: Letters only (a-z)
- **Avoid**: Numbers (look unprofessional, cause confusion)
- **Avoid**: Hyphens (hard to communicate verbally)
- **Avoid**: Unusual Unicode characters

## Naming Strategies

### 1. Compound Words

Combine two meaningful words into one:
- DropBox (drop + box)
- YouTube (you + tube)
- Facebook (face + book)
- WordPress (word + press)

**When to use**: When the combination creates clear meaning.

### 2. Invented Words

Create entirely new, pronounceable words:
- Spotify
- Hulu
- Etsy
- Zillow

**When to use**: When you want complete uniqueness and trademark ability.

### 3. Modified Spellings

Alter existing words slightly:
- Lyft (lift)
- Tumblr (tumbler)
- Flickr (flicker)
- Dribbble (dribble)

**When to use**: When the original word is taken but recognizable.

### 4. Action Words

Verb-based names suggesting what the product does:
- SendGrid
- JumpCloud
- LaunchDarkly
- ClickUp

**When to use**: When the action is the core value proposition.

### 5. Descriptive Names

Names that clearly describe the service:
- Grammarly
- Calendly
- Mailchimp
- Hootsuite

**When to use**: When clarity is more important than creativity.

### 6. Abstract/Metaphor

Names that evoke feeling or concept:
- Slack (relaxed)
- Notion (idea)
- Figma (abstract)
- Asana (yoga pose = balance)

**When to use**: When positioning matters more than description.

## Extension Selection

### Premium Extensions

- **.com** - Default choice, highest credibility, most expensive
- **.io** - Tech/startup standard, good availability
- **.co** - Short alternative to .com, growing acceptance

### Modern Tech Extensions

- **.app** - Mobile/web applications
- **.dev** - Developer tools and resources
- **.ai** - AI/ML products
- **.so** - Creative/cool factor

### Considerations

1. **Target audience**: Developers accept .io/.dev; general public prefers .com
2. **Availability**: .com often taken; alternatives may be available
3. **Price**: Some extensions (like .ai) have premium pricing
4. **Trust**: Unknown extensions may reduce trust

## Quality Checklist

Before suggesting a name, verify:

- [ ] Length is 6-15 characters
- [ ] Easy to spell (no unusual letter combinations)
- [ ] Easy to pronounce (say it aloud)
- [ ] No numbers or hyphens
- [ ] Relevant to the project's purpose
- [ ] Doesn't sound like another major brand
- [ ] Works as a verb ("just Uber it" pattern)
- [ ] Looks good in a URL bar
- [ ] Easy to type on mobile

## Common Pitfalls

### Avoid These Patterns

1. **Too clever**: Names that require explanation
2. **Too generic**: "WebApp" or "TechSolutions"
3. **Too long**: "BestOnlineShoppingExperience"
4. **Trademark issues**: Similar to major brands
5. **Negative meanings**: Check other languages
6. **Hard to hear**: Names that sound like other words

### Test Your Names

1. **Phone test**: Can you say it clearly over the phone?
2. **Radio test**: Would it work in a podcast ad?
3. **Search test**: Is it unique enough to search for?
4. **Social test**: Is the @handle available?
5. **Global test**: Any negative meanings elsewhere?

## Generation Process

When generating names for a project:

1. **Understand the project**: What does it do? Who is it for?
2. **Extract keywords**: Core features, benefits, feelings
3. **Apply strategies**: Try each naming approach
4. **Filter ruthlessly**: Apply quality checklist
5. **Present options**: Offer variety of styles
